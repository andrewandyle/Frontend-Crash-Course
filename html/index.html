<!--

Homepage is always called index.html - root domain

Tag Syntax:
Element names are surrounded by brackets
<tag>(content)</tag>
start tag, content, end tag (with /)
A self closing tag has no content (ex: <br />, but <br> is fine in HTML5)

HTML Structure:
<html>
  <head>
    <title> Page title </title>
    (remember that the title is literally what shows in the tab)
  </head>
  <body>
    (content)
    <h1>My first heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html>

<!DOCTYPE html> is a doctype, a declaration that should be the first thing on the webpage
Tells the browser what type of html this is written in

Some necessary Chrome commands:
Ctrl-U shows you the html that's being parsed
F12 gives you a console, elements tab shows html, you can also see JavaScript
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>HTML Cheat Sheet</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!--
    Headings:
    There are 6 headings: h1 through h6
    h1 makes the text bigger and adds padding around edges so next content will be pushed down
    h2 is a little smaller, then they each get smaller
    Text size can be changed with CSS
    -->
    <a href="blog.html">Go to blog</a>
    <hr>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>
    <!--
    Paragraphs
    Denoted by p
    The word lorem + tab will generate dummy text
    Adding another paragraph will automatically put it on a new line
    -->
    <p>
      This is a paragraph.
      <!--
      Strong: surround something and say this text should be strong (Default is bold)
      CSS can change what defines strong
      -->
      <strong>This is default strong text (bold). </strong>
      <!--
      Emphasize: emphasizes the text (Default is italic). Can also be changed with CSS
      -->
      <em>This is default emphasized text (italics).</em>
    <p>
      <!--
      Links: they are the a tag
      Give it an attribute (href="" is the link that we want to navigate to)
      Could be local or external
      Another attribute is target="_blank", which opens up a new tab with that site
      Usually used when you're navigating to an external site
      -->
      <a href="http://p5r.jp" target="_blank"> This is a link to my favorite game. Coming in the west in Spring 2020. Hope I can dodge spoilers. </a>
      <!--
      Attributes provide info about an element, placed within the start tag, uses key/value pairs
      <tagname attributename="attributevalue"> content </tagname>
      -->
    </p>
    <!--
    Inline Elements: don't start on a new line, only take necessary width
    Examples: <span>, <img>, <a>

    Block Elements: start on a new line, take full width available
    Examples: <div>, <h1> - <h6> (the headings we just did), <p> (paragraph), <form>
    -->

    <!--
    Lists
    Two types: unordered (ul) and ordered (ol)
    Each list element has an li tag
    Unordered: Adds bullets and also pads by default (pushed to the right)
    Can style the bullets with CSS
    Ordered: adds numbered items (1., 2., 3., etc.)
    -->
    <ul>
      <li>List Item 1</li>
      <li>List Item 2</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>List Item 1</li>
      <li>List Item 2</li>
    </ol>

    <!--
    Table
    use the table tag
    thead for the heading and tbody for the body
    -->
    <table>
      <!--
      tr is table row
      each heading will have a th tag
      -->
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Email</th>
          <th>Age</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <!--
      td is for the table data
      -->
      <tbody>
        <td>Andrew Le</td>
        <td>andrewandyle@gmail.com</td>
        <td>20</td>
      </tbody>
      <!--
      You can get multiple rows like this
      Can style later with CSS
      Don't use tables for your layout
      -->
      <tbody>
        <td>Jordan Gennero</td>
        <td>confidential</td>
        <td>20</td>

    <!--
    Forms
    No functionality with just html - only covering look
    Using the form tag
    action attribute submits form to a certain page
    method attribute - usually post, making a post request to the server (like adding data to a database)
    There's also get requests
    -->
    <form class="" action="process.php" method="post">
      <!--
      Labels (label) and Inputs (input)
      Input has an attribute called type (usually text input), name has to do with server-side programming
      name is how we would grab the value of this form
      Labels and inputs are inline, so by default they'd stay on the same line
      Wrap them in a div (block level elements) to put them on the next line
      Later: also add placeholder attribute for initial text (Ex: Enter first name)
      -->
      <div>
        <label> First Name </label>
        <input type="text" name="firstName", placeholder="Enter first name">
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
        <label> Last Name </label>
        <input type="text" name="lastName">

      <br>
      <!-- Can use type="email" to add some validation -->
      <div>
        <label> Email </label>
        <input type="email" name="email">
      </div>

      <div>
        <label> Message </label>
        <textarea name="message"></textarea>
      </div>
      <br>
      <!--
      Can use a select tag for multiple options (using option tags)
      Add the text to be displayed in the option in the content
      -->
      <div>
        <label> Gender </label>
        <select name="gender">
          <option value="male">Male</option>
          <option value="female">Female</option>
          <option value="other">Other...?</option>
        </select>
      </div>
      <br>
      <!--
      Can use type number, and add a predefined value (attribute) to input
      Gives arrows so number can go up or down
      -->
      <div>
        <label>Age</label>
        <input type="number" name="age" value="30">
      </div>
      <br>
      <!-- can also use type date for a date selector -->
      <div>
        <label>Birthday</label>
        <input type="date" name="birthday">
      </div>
      <br>
      <!-- add a submit button at the very end -->
      <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>

    <!--
    Buttons - using the button tag
    In order for a button to do something, you need JS
    click attribute adds an event, but you can't add functionality with just html
    -->
    <button>Click to do nothing.</button>

    <br>
    <!--
    Images - using the img tag - they're inline
    It's a self closing tag
    src attribute - set to name of image
    Put image in the same directory as html file
    If you put it in a subdirectory, you have to change subdirectory
    Ex: if it's in a folder named images, use images/joker.jpg
    alt attribute - if it can't find image, it'll display this text as an alternative
    Can also use width and height, but CSS can do this too

    You can wrap a link around the image as well
    If you put the image itself, then clicking it will open the image
    -->
    <a href="images/joker.jpg">
      <img src="images/joker.jpg" alt="My Sample Image" width="200">
    </a>

    <!--
    Quotations
    Three different tags:
    blockquote - takes in an attribute called cite (where the quote comes from)
    abbr - abbreviation - wrap text in an abbr tag, give it a title attribute for the abbreviation itself
    cite - italicizes the text, lets browser know that it's something being cited
    -->

    <blockquote cite="https://p5r.jp/">
      Let's do it! DO IT! RAVAGE THEM!
    </blockquote>

    <p>Please don't spoil <abbr title="Persona 5 Royal">P5R</abbr> for me.</p>

    HTML5 Semantic Tags - clearly describes its meaning to both browser and developer
    header, footer, aside, main, article, nav, section, details
    -->

    <!--
    div with style attribute
    margin top of 500 pixels - makes it to where there's more room to scroll
    -->
    <div style="margin-top:500px"></div>
